# 💳 Console MCCMA Program (C#)
**Multiple Credit Card Management Application**  
Developed in **C#** as part of the **COS20007 Object-Oriented Programming** subject.

This console-based application allows users to manage **multiple credit cards**, their transactions, limits, statuses, and more. It follows strict object-oriented design principles and demonstrates practical use of class hierarchies, encapsulation, and file handling.

## 🧱 Object-Oriented Principles Used

- ✅ **Encapsulation**  
  - Backing fields for all card and transaction data  
- ✅ **Inheritance (if applicable)**  
  - Could include transaction or card type hierarchies  
- ✅ **Abstraction**  
  - Separation of logic between UI, management, and data classes  
- ✅ **Modularity**  
  - All responsibilities divided cleanly into individual C# files
